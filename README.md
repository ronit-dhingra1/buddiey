The informational website says it all about what there is to Buddiey, so feel free to go there and see it for yourself! If you want a simple explanation directly on the README.md, then keep reading.

> The Buddiey web app (app.buddiey.live) is based on newer technologies, such as HTML5 and CSS, so that web page load times and responsiveness is much better, and doesn't require the use of outdated software, like Adobe Flash and even Microsoft Silverlight. The backend is built on TensorFlow and Keras, and the REST API is served using TensorFlow serving, so that the web app can make requests (the user message) and get a response (Buddiey's text response), which gets displayed to the user.



# Wait, what is Buddiey?

> Buddiey was originally a science fair project created by a team known as the Buddiey Builders. It evolved to be a full-stack web application for isolated and lonely senior citizens to feel more confortable and more happy in general. The robot you talk to, Buddiey, is pre-loaded with lots of knowledge, so he knows exactly what to say, when following a very basic guideline in commands.
